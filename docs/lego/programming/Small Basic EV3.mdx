# Small Basic EV3
EV3 Basic is an alternative method of programming for EV3 Mindstorms.  
It uses Microsoft Small Basic IDE and its corresponding EV3 extension  
  
For more information visit, [Microsoft Small Basic][MSB] or [EV3 Basic Extension][EV3B]

## Why use Small Basic EV3?

You might already be familiar with EV3-G and EV3 Classroom.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ev3-g"
  values={[
    {label: 'EV3-G', value: 'ev3-g'},
    {label: 'EV3 Classroom', value: 'ev3-classroom'},
    {label: 'Small Basic EV3', value: 'sbev3'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="ev3-g">

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ev3-classroom">

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sbev3">

  ```
  for i = 1 to 4
      Motor.Move("BC", 50, 720, "True")
      Motor.MoveSync("BC", 30, 0, 320, "True") 
  EndFor
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

However, they both come with their sets of issues. For example, EV3-G is known
to be very laggy, particularly with large codebases;  
  
EV3 Classroom and Small Basic EV3 does not support the use of HiTechnic Color Sensors.  
  
Small Basic doesn't require you to load up an SD card and wait spend a long time :hourglass: just to wait for a firmware update.  
  
At the same time , you can also you full fludged programming techniques such as arrays that is not support in EV3-G or EV3 Classroom.
  
## Getting Started

Before you get your hand dirty and start programming like the Russians, you might want to read up on the syntax of [Microsoft Small Basic][SBD] as it is a proprietary language by Microsoft.  
  
Once you are done with that, go download the [Small Basic IDE][MSB-Install] and the [EV3 Basic Extension][EV3B-Install]

## Common functions you might need
```
LCD.Text("Hello")
```  
```
TextWindow.Write("Hello")
```
```
TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello")
```
```
Program.Delay(Duration)
```
```
Motor.Invert("Port number")
```
## Basic Movment
```
print("Hello world")
```
```
print("Hello world")
```
## Sensors
```
print("Hello world")
```
## PID

```pseudo 
Motor.Invert("B")
'[2] = Right sensor = Port 3

TotalRGBTH[1] = 524 

TotalRGB[1] = 0

lightVal = 0

Port = 1
Movement = 0
Last_Error = 0
TP = 100 '100
Kp = 0.12 '0.12
Ki = 0.005 '0.005
Kd = 0.4 '0.4
Intergal = 0

Sensor.SetMode(2, 4)

While "True"
  readVal()
  PD()
EndWhile
  
Sub PD
  Error = lightVal - TotalRGBTH[1]
  Intergal = Error + Intergal*0.5
  Correction = (Error * Kp) + (Error - Last_Error)*Kd + Intergal*Ki
  Motor.StartSync("BC",Math.Max(Math.Min((TP + Correction),100),-100),Math.Max(Math.Min((TP - Correction),100),-100))
  Last_Error = Error
EndSub

Sub readVal
  rawValue = Sensor.ReadRaw(2,3)
  lightVal = rawValue[0] + rawValue[1] + rawValue[2]
EndSub
```

## Bluetooth Connection (Optional)
