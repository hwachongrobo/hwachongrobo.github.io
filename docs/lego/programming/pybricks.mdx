# Pybricks

Pybricks is an alternative method of programming for EV3 Mindstorms endorsed by LEGOÂ®.

For more information, visit [](https://pybricks.com/).

## Why use Pybricks?

You might already be familiar with EV3-G and EV3 Classroom.

However, they both come with their sets of issues. For example, EV3-G is known to be very laggy, particularly with large codebases; and EV3 Classroom does not support the use of HiTechnic Color Sensors.

Pybricks uses python, a text-based programming language, allowing for much more customisation at the expense of a greater learning curve. It is also based on ev3dev, a very mature open-source library.

Note that Pybricks requires the use of a MicroSD card as it needs to be run on custom firmware.

## Getting Started

The Pybricks team has already written a very well-documented tutorial on how to get started at [](https://pybricks.com/install/mindstorms-ev3/installation/).

You would need to flash the firmware onto a MicroSD card and set-up the Visual Studio Code IDE for EV3 MicroPython development.

## Using Pybricks

The full documentation is available at [](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/).

Instructions on how to interface with EV3 devices can be found more specifically at [](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/ev3devices.html) and there is also a `DriveBase` class that you can use at [](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/robotics.html).

### HiTechnic Color Sensor

As the HiTechnic Color Sensor is not an official product provided by Lego, Pybricks does not natively support it. However, we can still use it as the ev3dev community has already written code to work with it.

The documentation for using ev3dev sensors with Pybricks can be found at [](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/iodevices/ev3devsensor.html).

Conveniently, someone has also written code to use the Hitechnic Color Sensor at [](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues/1292#issuecomment-508627948).

```python
from pybricks.ev3devio import Ev3devSensor


class HTColorSensor(Ev3devSensor):
    _ev3dev_driver_name = "ht-nxt-color-v2"
    _number_of_values = 4

    def _open_files(self):
        super()._open_files()
        self._command_file = open(self.path + "command", "w")

    def _close_files(self):
        super()._close_files()
        self._command_file.close()

    # Set the scan frequency to 50 Hz.
    def set_frequency_50hz(self):
        self._command_file.write("50HZ")
        self._command_file.flush()

    # Set the scan frequency to 60 Hz.
    def set_frequency_60hz(self):
        self._command_file.write("60HZ")
        self._command_file.flush()

    # Returns a tuple of color values: (red, blue, green, white). Ranges from 0 to 255 for each.
    def rgbw(self):
        self._mode("RGB")
        errors = 0
        while True:
            try:
                return self._value(0), self._value(1), self._value(2), self._value(3)
            except:
                errors += 1  # may raise ENODEV error
                # returns tuple of zeros if there are two consecutive errors
                if errors > 1:
                    return 0, 0, 0, 0

    # Returns the color index. Ranges from 0 to 17.
    def color(self):
        self._mode("COLOR")
        errors = 0
        while True:
            try:
                return self._value(0)
            except:
                errors += 1  # may raise ENODEV error
                # returns zero if there are two consecutive errors
                if errors > 1:
                    return 0
```

You can use it like this:

```python
ht_color_sensor = HTColorSensor(Port.S1)  # initialise sensor at port 1

color = ht_color_sensor.color()
print(color)  # prints number from 0 to 17 corresponding to the detected color

r, g, b, w = ht_color_sensor.rgbw()
print(r, g, b, w)  # prints the raw values for red, green, blue, and white
```
