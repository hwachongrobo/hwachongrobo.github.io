# Pybricks

Pybricks is an alternative method of programming for EV3 Mindstorms endorsed by
LEGOÂ®.

For more information, visit [pybricks.com][].

## Why use Pybricks?

You might already be familiar with EV3-G and EV3 Classroom.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env pybricks-micropython
from pybricks.hubs import EV3Brick
from pybricks.ev3devices import Motor
from pybricks.parameters import Port

# Create your objects here

# Initialize the EV3 Brick.
ev3 = EV3Brick()

# Initialize a motor at port B.
test_motor = Motor(Port.B)

# Write your program here

# Play a sound.
ev3.speaker.beep()

# Run the motor up to 500 degrees per second.
# To a target angle of 90 degrees.
test_motor.run_target(500, 90)

# Play another beep sound.
ev3.speaker.beep(frequency=1000, duration=500)
```

</Tabs>

However, they both come with their sets of issues. For example, EV3-G is known
to be very laggy, particularly with large codebases; and EV3 Classroom does not
support the use of HiTechnic Color Sensors.

Pybricks uses python, a text-based programming language, allowing for much more
customisation at the expense of a greater learning curve. It is also based on
ev3dev, a very mature open-source library.

Note that Pybricks requires the use of a MicroSD card as it needs to be run on
custom firmware.

## Getting Started

The Pybricks team has already written a very well-documented tutorial on how to
get started [here][pybricks installation].

You would need to flash the firmware onto a MicroSD card and set-up the Visual
Studio Code IDE for EV3 MicroPython development.

## Using Pybricks

The full documentation is available [here][pybricks docs].

Instructions on how to interface with EV3 devices can be found more specifically
[here][pybricks docs ev3devices] and there is also a `DriveBase` class that you
can use [here][pybricks docs robotics].

### HiTechnic Color Sensor

As the HiTechnic Color Sensor is not an official product provided by Lego,
Pybricks does not natively support it. However, we can still use it as the
ev3dev community has already written code to work with it.

The documentation for using ev3dev sensors with Pybricks can be found
[here](pybricks docs ev3devsensor).

Conveniently, someone has also written code to use the Hitechnic Color Sensor at
[this random GitHub issue](hitechnic color sensor issue).

```python
from pybricks.ev3devio import Ev3devSensor


class HTColorSensor(Ev3devSensor):
    _ev3dev_driver_name = "ht-nxt-color-v2"
    _number_of_values = 4

    def _open_files(self):
        super()._open_files()
        self._command_file = open(self.path + "command", "w")

    def _close_files(self):
        super()._close_files()
        self._command_file.close()

    # Set the scan frequency to 50 Hz.
    def set_frequency_50hz(self):
        self._command_file.write("50HZ")
        self._command_file.flush()

    # Set the scan frequency to 60 Hz.
    def set_frequency_60hz(self):
        self._command_file.write("60HZ")
        self._command_file.flush()

    # Returns a tuple of color values: (red, blue, green, white). Ranges from 0 to 255 for each.
    def rgbw(self):
        self._mode("RGB")
        errors = 0
        while True:
            try:
                return self._value(0), self._value(1), self._value(2), self._value(3)
            except:
                errors += 1  # may raise ENODEV error
                # returns tuple of zeros if there are two consecutive errors
                if errors > 1:
                    return 0, 0, 0, 0

    # Returns the color index. Ranges from 0 to 17.
    def color(self):
        self._mode("COLOR")
        errors = 0
        while True:
            try:
                return self._value(0)
            except:
                errors += 1  # may raise ENODEV error
                # returns zero if there are two consecutive errors
                if errors > 1:
                    return 0
```

You can use it like this:

```python
ht_color_sensor = HTColorSensor(Port.S1)  # initialise sensor at port 1

color = ht_color_sensor.color()
print(color)  # prints number from 0 to 17 corresponding to the detected color

r, g, b, w = ht_color_sensor.rgbw()
print(r, g, b, w)  # prints the raw values for red, green, blue, and white
```
