## Why use Small Basic EV3?

You might already be familiar with EV3-G and EV3 Classroom.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ev3-g"
  values={[
    {label: 'EV3-G', value: 'ev3-g'},
    {label: 'EV3 Classroom', value: 'ev3-classroom'},
    {label: 'Small Basic EV3', value: 'sbev3'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="ev3-g">

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ev3-classroom">

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sbev3">

  ```
  for i = 1 to 4
      Motor.Move("BC", 50, 720, "True")
      Motor.MoveSync("BC", 30, 0, 320, "True") 
  EndFor
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

However, they both come with their sets of issues. For example, EV3-G is known
to be very laggy, particularly with large codebases;  
  
EV3 Classroom and Small Basic EV3 does not support the use of HiTechnic Color Sensors.  
  
Small Basic EV3 uses a smiliar concept to Python
  
## Getting Started

The EV3 Basic team has already written a very well-documented tutorial on how to
get started refer to the top few links.
