## Why use Small Basic EV3?

You might already be familiar with EV3-G and EV3 Classroom.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="ev3-g"
    values={[
        {label: 'EV3-G', value: 'ev3-g'},
        {label: 'EV3 Classroom', value: 'ev3-classroom'},
        {label: 'Small Basic EV3', value: 'sbev3'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="ev3-g">

However, they both come with their sets of issues. For example, EV3-G is known
to be very laggy, particularly with large codebases; and EV3 Classroom does not
support the use of HiTechnic Color Sensors.
