## What is AutoCAD?  

AutoCAD is a commercial computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software application. Developed and marketed by Autodesk. (not copied from google)

## Installing AutoCAD  

AutoCAD has this stupid licensing system that wants you to prove that you are a student in order to use the software for free or else you have to pay like a 100 bucks every month  

Go to this website to proceed with the installation: https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual  

Scroll down until you find AutoCAD (Choose the Mac version if you're on MacOS) and click get started  

You will be prompted to sign in or create an account. Most likely you don't have an account so click **create account**.  

Enter SG as your country or shit won't work, then set educational role as **student** and set Instuition Type as High School/Secondary. Put your legit birthday cos you will need to verify it later.

Click next and enter your legit name pls and your school email (such as 20xxxxx@student.hci.edu.sg). Put your paswsword and don't forgot cos no one is gonna help you if you forget. Click **create account**  

Enter **Hwa Chong Institution (Bukit Timah)** as the educational instuition name or your school name. Enrolled date put as **01/20xx (Sec one year)** and graduation date as **31/12/20xx (JC 2 Year)**. After you input everything just click **next** then they will redirect you to some gay webite. So just go back to: https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual and scroll down until you find AutoCAD (Choose the Mac version if you're on MacOS) and click get started.  

You should already be signed in into your account but if your not just sign in  

All the info should be autofilled so just click **confirm**  

Now they will ask you to verify your idendity as a student which is stupid i also dk why they want but ok  

Simply upload a document within 14 days. Best option is a **pic of your report card** clearly displaying **your school name** and **your name**. Then click submit. If you are approved to use the software they will send an email to your school email.  

If you need help or don't have any school document for verification just ask some senior for help
