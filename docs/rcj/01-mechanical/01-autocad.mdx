## What is AutoCAD?  

AutoCAD is a commercial computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software application. Developed and marketed by Autodesk. (not copied from google)

## Installing AutoCAD  

AutoCAD has this stupid licensing system that wants you to prove that you are a student in order to use the software for free or else you have to pay like a 100 bucks every month  

Go to this website to proceed with the installation: https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual  

Scroll down until you find AutoCAD (Choose the Mac version if you're on MacOS) and click get started  

You will be prompted to sign in or create an account. Most likely you don't have an account so click **create account**.  

Enter SG as your country or shit won't work, then set educational role as **student** and set Instuition Type as High School/Secondary. Put your legit birthday cos you will need to verify it later.  

![autocad-login][]

[autocad-login]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/loginpage1.png  

Click next and enter your legit name pls and your school email (such as 20xxxxx@student.hci.edu.sg). Put your paswsword and don't forgot cos no one is gonna help you if you forget. Click **create account**  

Enter **Hwa Chong Institution (Bukit Timah)** as the educational instuition name or your school name. Enrolled date put as **01/20xx (Sec one year)** and graduation date as **31/12/20xx (JC 2 Year)**. After you input everything just click **next** then they will redirect you to some gay webite. So just go back to: https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual and scroll down until you find AutoCAD (Choose the Mac version if you're on MacOS) and click get started.  

You should already be signed in into your account but if your not just sign in  

All the info should be autofilled so just click **confirm**  

Now they will ask you to verify your idendity as a student which is stupid i also dk why they want but ok  

Simply upload a document within 14 days. Best option is a **pic of your report card** clearly displaying **your school name** and **your name**. Then click submit. If you are approved to use the software they will send an email to your school email.  

If you need help or don't have any school document for verification just ask some senior for help

## Basic Setup  

# Login and account  

After launching AutoCAD, you will be prompted to enter a license code or log in. Log in with your school account that you register for AutoCAD with or else you won't we able to use all the functions in the AutoCAD.  

# Setting up 3D Workspace  

Hit new on the left side and yow will enter the workspace. Hit the **gear icon** at the bottom right of the screen and set it to **3D Modelling** and boom now u have a sexy workspace  

![autocad-3dsettings][]

Next, click on the up arrow icon on the bottom right of the screen, beside the square icon and turn all the options on  

![autocad-snapoptions][]

[autocad-snapoptions]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/snapoptions.png  

Next, enter `units` into the command bar below and a window should pop up. Set the **precision** to the one with the most zeros and make sure units is in **millimeters**  

You can also click **F8** or **Fn + F8** if you have Fn lock on to turn on ortho. Ortho is basically a setting that allows stuff to snap to 90 degree angles when drawing. 

# Snapping to grid  

Snapping to grid can be helpful when you want to be accurate to a certain extent. To turn on snap, click on the icon of nine dots near the bottom right corner 

![autocad-snaptogrid][]

Now your cursor will snap to the grid when drawing objects

## Baic functions  

# Line  

To create a line, click on the line tool at the top of the screen or enter `l` into the command bar  

![autocad-line][]

[autocad-line]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/line.png   

To use the line tool, simply click on the start postion, click but do not hold, then click on the end postion to draw the line, you can continue to click on the next point if you want to draw multiple connected lines. To end the function, click on the **Esc** key.  

Lines are used to create 2D shapes which you can turn into 3D objects later on but you will have to use a certain command to join them together into a shape so that they can be extrueded, because lines won't be connected into a polyline  (a compount shape where line are already connected together) by default.  

# Rectangle 

The Rectangle tool is used to create rectangles and squares more quickly instead of using multiples lines to create rectangles or squares. The Rectangle tool also allow the draw shapes to immediately combine into a polyline (a compount shape where line are already connected together)  

To use the tool enter `rec` into the command bar or just click on the rectangle tool icon at the top of the screen  

Similar to the line tool, just click, move and click again  

# Circle  

To create a circle, click on the circle tool or enter `c` into the command bar  

Click to specify the **center** of the circle, move the the second spot to specify the **radius** or the cirle. If you want to specify the **diameter** of the circle instead, just click `d` and press enter then enter the diameter and hit enter  

# Selecting objects 

To select objects, theres 2 types of selection.  

-The first type is the blue selection, **where you click but not hold, from the top left to the bottom right, and click again**. A blue area should appear. For this type of selection, only objects that are fully within the area will be selected.  

![autocad-blue-selection][]

[autocad-blue-selection]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/blueselection.png   

-The second type is the green selection, **where you click but not hold, from the top right to the bottom left, and click again**. A green area should appear. For this type of selection, any object that has some part of it within the selection area will be selected, and the object does not have to be fully within the area to be selected.  

![autocad-green-selection][]

[autocad-green-selection]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/greenselection.png   

Selected objects will be highlighted with a white glow  

# Forming a polyline  

By default, AutoCAD does not recognise multiple lines as a shape even though they seem to form a shape. AutoCAD only recognises the lines as a shape when you join the lines into a **polyline**  

For example in this picture below, these 4 lines are not actually connected into a square  

![autocad-polylineeg][]

To connect the lines, select all of them, the type `join` into the command bar and hit enter
