## What is AutoCAD?  

AutoCAD is a commercial computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software application. Developed and marketed by Autodesk. (not copied from google)

## Installing AutoCAD  

AutoCAD has this stupid licensing system that wants you to prove that you are a student in order to use the software for free or else you have to pay like a 100 bucks every month  

Go to this website to proceed with the installation: https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual  

Scroll down until you find AutoCAD (Choose the Mac version if you're on MacOS) and click get started  

You will be prompted to sign in or create an account. Most likely you don't have an account so click **create account**.  

Enter SG as your country or shit won't work, then set educational role as **student** and set Instuition Type as High School/Secondary. Put your legit birthday cos you will need to verify it later.  

*Note: This tutorial is based on AutoCAD 2022*

![autocad-login][]

[autocad-login]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/loginpage1.png  

Click next and enter your legit name pls and your school email (such as 20xxxxx@student.hci.edu.sg). Put your paswsword and don't forgot cos no one is gonna help you if you forget. Click **create account**  

Enter **Hwa Chong Institution (Bukit Timah)** as the educational instuition name or your school name. Enrolled date put as **01/20xx (Sec one year)** and graduation date as **31/12/20xx (JC 2 Year)**. After you input everything just click **next** then they will redirect you to some gay webite. So just go back to: https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual and scroll down until you find AutoCAD (Choose the Mac version if you're on MacOS) and click get started.  

You should already be signed in into your account but if your not just sign in  

All the info should be autofilled so just click **confirm**  

Now they will ask you to verify your idendity as a student which is stupid i also dk why they want but ok  

Simply upload a document within 14 days. Best option is a **pic of your report card** clearly displaying **your school name** and **your name**. Then click submit. If you are approved to use the software they will send an email to your school email.  

If you need help or don't have any school document for verification just ask some senior for help

## Basic Setup  

# Login and account  

After launching AutoCAD, you will be prompted to enter a license code or log in. Log in with your school account that you register for AutoCAD with or else you won't we able to use all the functions in the AutoCAD.  

# Setting up 3D Workspace  

Hit new on the left side and yow will enter the workspace. Hit the **gear icon** at the bottom right of the screen and set it to **3D Modelling** and boom now u have a sexy workspace  

![autocad-3dsettings][]

[autocad-3dsettings]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/3dworkspace1.png  

Next, click on the up arrow icon on the bottom right of the screen, beside the square icon and turn all the options on  

![autocad-snapoptions][]

[autocad-snapoptions]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/snapoptions.png  

Next, enter `units` into the command bar below and a window should pop up. Set the **precision** to the one with the most zeros and make sure units is in **millimeters**  

You can also click **F8** or **Fn + F8** if you have Fn lock on to turn on ortho. Ortho is basically a setting that allows stuff to snap to 90 degree angles when drawing. 

# Snapping to grid  

Snapping to grid can be helpful when you want to be accurate to a certain extent. To turn on snap, click on the icon of nine dots near the bottom right corner 

![autocad-snaptogrid][]

[autocad-snaptogrid]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/snaptogrid.png  

Now your cursor will snap to the grid when drawing objects

## Basic functions  

# Panning and camera angle  

To pan around in a 360 view, hold **Shift** and hold down the **Middle Mouse Button** (Mouse scrollwheel), then drag your mouse around to pan  

To pan round in a 2D angle, hold down the **Middle Mouse Button** (Mouse scrollwheel) and drag your mouse around to pan  

You can also click the **Home** icon at the top right of the screen to return to the default view  

![autocad-panningeg1][]

[autocad-panningeg1]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/panningeg1.png  

You can also click and drag the cube icon on the top right to pan in a 360 view  

![autocad-panningeg2][]

[autocad-panningeg2]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/panningeg2.png  

# Line  

To create a line, click on the line tool at the top of the screen or enter `l` into the command bar  

![autocad-line][]

[autocad-line]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/line.png   

To use the line tool, simply click on the start postion, click but do not hold, then click on the end postion to draw the line, you can continue to click on the next point if you want to draw multiple connected lines. To end the function, click on the **Esc** key.  

Lines are used to create 2D shapes which you can turn into 3D objects later on but you will have to use a certain command to join them together into a shape so that they can be extrueded, because lines won't be connected into a polyline  (a compount shape where line are already connected together) by default.  

# Rectangle 

The Rectangle tool is used to create rectangles and squares more quickly instead of using multiples lines to create rectangles or squares. The Rectangle tool also allow the draw shapes to immediately combine into a polyline (a compount shape where line are already connected together)  

To use the tool enter `rec` into the command bar or just click on the rectangle tool icon at the top of the screen  

Similar to the line tool, just click, move and click again  

# Circle  

To create a circle, click on the circle tool or enter `c` into the command bar  

Click to specify the **center** of the circle, move the the second spot to specify the **radius** or the cirle. If you want to specify the **diameter** of the circle instead, just click `d` and press enter then enter the diameter and hit enter  

# Selecting objects  

To select objects, theres 2 types of selection.  

- The first type is the blue selection, **where you click but not hold, from the top left to the bottom right, and click again**. A blue area should appear. For this type of selection, only objects that are fully within the area will be selected.  

![autocad-blue-selection][]

[autocad-blue-selection]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/blueselection.png   

- The second type is the green selection, **where you click but not hold, from the top right to the bottom left, and click again**. A green area should appear. For this type of selection, any object that has some part of it within the selection area will be selected, and the object does not have to be fully within the area to be selected.  

![autocad-green-selection][]

[autocad-green-selection]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/greenselection.png   

Selected objects will be highlighted with a white glow  

# Forming a polyline  

By default, AutoCAD does not recognise multiple lines as a shape even though they seem to form a shape. AutoCAD only recognises the lines as a shape when you join the lines into a **polyline**  

For example in this picture below, these 4 lines are not actually connected into a square  

![autocad-polylineeg][]

[autocad-polylineeg]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/polylineeg.png  

To connect the lines, select all of them, the type `join` into the command bar and hit enter

![autocad-polylineeg2][]

[autocad-polylineeg2]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/polylineeg2.png  

Now when the cursor is hovered over the lines, it gets highlighted all together and AutoCAD says that its a polyline  

![autocad-polylineeg3][]

[autocad-polylineeg3]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/polylineeg3.png  

When we have a polyline, we can proceed to **extrution**

# Extrude  

To extrude and object, click on the object or select it so that its highlighted in blue, then type `extrude` into the command bar and click enter. A 3D object should be rendered and you can drag to specify the height and click to confirm or enter the height in mm and click enter  

![autocad-extrudeeg1][]

[autocad-extrudeeg1]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/extrudeeg1.png  

There are different ways to render objects in AutoCAD, the one by default is the **2D wireframe**  

To change, click on the **"2D wireframe"** at the top right of the screen and choose the mode you want

![autocad-viewingmodes][]

[autocad-viewingmodes]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/viewingmodes.png  

The most common types are:

- 2D Wireframe: Mainly used when drawing 2D shapes and better for visualisation when you have fewer objects in the workspace. However, when they are too many objects, it can become messy

- Realistic: This one is the best type for visualising 3D Objects and get a good look at how your model will look all together  

- Shaded with edges: This one is similar to realisitc but there are still outlines making it easier to see the edges  

# Box  

If you want to create cuboid faster without drawing a rectangle then extruding, you can use the box tool.  

Just type `box` into the command bar and hit enter, then click on the first corner of the cuboid, then click on the opposite corner of the **base** of the cuboid. After that specify the height by clicking at where you want it to be, or just enter the height  

![autocad-boxtool][]

[autocad-boxtool]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/boxtool.png  

# Moving objects  

Theres 2 ways to move an object:  

- This first way allow you to move an object in any of the 3 aix. This method is used when you want to move an object along a specify axis only. Just click on the object you want to move, then click on the arrow corresponding to the axis you want to move it along and just move your mouse to the point you want to move it to and click again  

![autocad-3axismove][]

[autocad-3axismove]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/3axismove.png  

- The other way is the move function. This method is used when you want to an object to a specify coordinate. Click on the object you want to move, the type `move` and then click enter. You will first be asked to enter the base point. The base point the relative point of the object that you want to move. When entering the coordinates later, this base point will be moved to the coordinates you speicfied. Usually, we set the base point as the center or the corner of an object, depending on what you want to do. You will then be asked to enter 3 number which are the X, Y and Z coordinates respectively. Type the X coordinate first then press the **comma** key, then enter the Y coordinate, then press the **comma** key, then type the Z coordinate, then hit **enter**  

![autocad-movefunction][]

# Subtract  

The subtract tool is used to create more complex shapes by using one shape to subtract from another shape  

Start by creating 2 or more 3D objects that have the areas that you want to subtract overlapping. For example in this picture this cyliner is overlapping within this cuboid  

![autocad-subtracteg1][]

[autocad-subtracteg1]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/subtracteg1.png  

Next, they will prompt you to select the objecct you want to subtract from, so in this example I will select the cubiod  

![autocad-subtracteg2][]

[autocad-subtracteg2]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/subtracteg2.png  

![autocad-subtracteg3][]

[autocad-subtracteg3]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/subtracteg3.png  

Hit **enter** after selecting the objects you want to subtract from  

Next, you will be prompted to select the objects will want to subtract. Basically, just select the objects that you want to cut off from the main object. In this example, I will select the cylinder in the center  

![autocad-subtracteg4][]

[autocad-subtracteg4]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/subtracteg4.png  

After thata just hit **enter**. After clicking enter, the subtraction should be executed

![autocad-subtracteg5][]

[autocad-subtracteg5]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/subtracteg5.png  

# Object union  

To combine 2 more more 3D objects together into 1, you have to use the **union** function to union them together  

![autocad-unioneg1][]

[autocad-unioneg1]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/unioneg1.png  

In this example, there is a triangular ramp that I want to union with this other solid from earlier. Type `union` into the command bar then hit enter. Then select the objects you want to union and hit enter  

![autocad-unioneg2][]

[autocad-unioneg2]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/unioneg2.png  

As seen, the 2 solids have been unioned

# Slicing  

Sometimes you want to slice an object into 2 parts to make editing each part easier etc  

To slice and object, draw a rectangle that covers the whole area you want to slice. This rectangle acts as a knife  

![autocad-slicingeg1][]

[autocad-slicingeg1]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/slicingeg1.png  

For example in this pic above, this rectangle is made to cut off this extra triangular ramp part on the right  

After you have drawn your rectangle, type `slice` into the command bar. You will be prompted to select the object you want to slice, so just select your 3D solid, then hit enter. 

![autocad-slicingeg2][]

[autocad-slicingeg2]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/slicingeg2.png  

Next, you will be required select a slicing plane. Since we are using a rectangle to slice, type `o` and click enter, this will swap to a planar object for slicing, such as the rectangle we have drawn here. After that just select the rectangle and click enter  

You will be asked to choose which side of the object you want to keep. Most of the time we will keep both and just delete the side we don't want later. If you want to keep both sides, type `b` and click enter  

![autocad-slicingeg3][]

[autocad-slicingeg3]: /img/docs/soccer/autocad/slicingeg3.png  

As you can see, the object is now sliced into 2 parts yey :>
