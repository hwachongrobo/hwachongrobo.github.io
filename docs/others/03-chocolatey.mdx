# Chocolatey

Package Manager For Windows

As all of you may know Im lazy. So after every clean install of Windows, its a pain to have to redownload everything. Going to their respective websites and download their install files. Therefore, I use Chocolatey - a windows package manager.

# Chocolatey install

Open up power shell and paste this line in

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

What it does I dont really know :confused:

After this you can just type `choco install <package name>` into your powershell terminal and boom it will be automatically installed

If you want to get some reference, this is what I install

```powershell
choco install googlechrome firefox 7zip vlc python3 git vscode audacity autocad eagle mongodb-compass obs-studio obs-virtualcam qbittorrent winfetch whatsapp steam epicgameslauncher geforce-experience hwmonitor chrome-remote-desktop-host nodejs-lts -y
```
