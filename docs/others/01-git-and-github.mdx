# Git and Github

## What is Git?  
  
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.  
  
## What is Github?
  
GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git  

## Setting up

### Github  
  
You dont have to download Github, you just have to Sign up for an account  

### Git
Git : https://git-scm.com/downloads
  
Leave everything as default settings (Bascially click yes for everything)
  
Before you go pushing and pulling repositories, rememeber to type this inside your preferred terminal (Get Windows Terminal)
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"
```
  
When you push something, they might show a pop up 
![authenticateWithGithub][]  
Do not fret and follow their instructions
## Usage
### Github  
  
The main thing you use Github for is to create repositories  
  
If you signed up Github for the first time, they would go through the process of creating a repository  
  
To recap, 

![createNewRepo][]  

In your home page, click on **New** in the top left part of the screen and boom, fill in the blanks and a repository is create

### Git
Using Git in command line interface is recommeneded compared to using the UI Version of it. So the following will include the commonly used git commands.  
  
#### Cloning a repository
  
To clone a repository from Github, go to the repository on Github and click the code button

![clickOnCopy][]
  
And copy the HTTPS link  
  
In your command line paste the following command

```
git clone <insert repository url>
```
    
A good practice is to run ```git pull``` before editing your code so that you can be editing on the latest version of the code  

#### Pushing your code
  
Another good practice is to push code frequently to Github. Think Github as your backup to your code. And also include useful commit messages.
  
To push a change to Github:
```
git add .
git commit -m "<insert a useful change message>"
git push
```
  
#### Reverting your code
  
To revert a change:
```
git log --oneline # To view commit history 
```
  
It should look like this  
![commitHistory][]  
The left side is the commit hash, so copy that and replace it here  
```
git revert <insert commit hash>
```
⚠️ All the code will be reverted back to the commit hash you set⚠️
