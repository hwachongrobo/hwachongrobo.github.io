## Usage
  
# Git
Using Git in command line interface is recommeneded compared to using the UI Version of it. So the following will include the commonly used git commands.  
  
A good practice is to run ```git pull``` before editing your code so that you can be editing on the latest version of the code  
  
Another good practice is to push code frequently to Github. Think Github as your backup to your code. And also include useful commit messages.
  
To push a change to Github:
```
git add .
git commit -m "<insert a useful change message>"
git push
```
  
To revert a change:
```
git log --oneline # To view commit history 
```
  
It should look like this  
![commitHistory][]  
The left side is the commit hash, so copy that and replace it here  
```
git revert <insert commit hash>
```
⚠️ All the code will be reverted back to the commit hash you set⚠️
