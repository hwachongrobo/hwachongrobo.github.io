# Cura  

## What is Ultimaker Cura?

Ultimaker Cura is a software that changes .stl (file format native to the stereolithography CAD software) files into .gcode files (contains commands in G-Code, which is a language used to describe how a 3D printer should print a job)



## Installation and setup

Install Ultimaker Cura here: https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura



Cura will prompt you to select a 3D printer, so select <b> Creality CR-10 </b>  
Skip all the account creating bs and whatever they want to advertise.

**Cooling**  

Leave it as the defaults later u change something u break the shit not my problem  

**Support**  

Turn on generate support and set **support overhang angle** to **50 degrees**

**Build Plate Adhesion**  

Set **adhension type** to **raft** and **raft extra margin** and **raft smoothing** to **5mm**  

Set **raft air gap** to **0.38mm**

**Don't touch the rest of the shit or something gonna break**


## Importing and exporting

Hit the shortcut key **Ctrl + O** and select .stl file that you exported from AutoCAD or other CAD software  

Your 3D model should open up in Cura and click on the model so it gets highlighted and you can edit it

Use the following tools to move your model around:  

- Move tool: Used to move the object around  

Simply click and drag

![cura3][]

[cura3]: /img/docs/soccer/cura/step-3.png 

- Scale tool: Used to enlarge the object  

Usually not used unless you want to make last minute changes. This tool is not reliable and you should just make changes in your CAD software instead  

![cura4][]

[cura4]: /img/docs/soccer/cura/step-4.png  

- Rotation tool: Used to rotate the object (i know i smart cause every 60 secs in africa one min passes)  

Drag the arrow to turn the object  

Good practice to keep **Snap Rotation** on turning is more accurate  

- The last 2 tools are useless uwu

# Some good practices and tips  

- Use right click to pan around and rotate the camera angle  
- Use scroll wheel to scale the camera  
- You should always keep your object as flat as possible as to minimise the support created to save printing filament  

# Exporting  

Before exporting, hit **slice** at the bottom right  

Hit preview to make sure nothing is weird  

Drag the slider at the bottom to see a very very cool priting animation  

Drag the slider on the right to see the different layers (very cool hor)  

The blue layer at the bottom is the raft, the raft is an extra layer at the bottom of the object to prevent something called elephant feet, and you can peel it of later (elephant feet is some unintentional protrution near the bottom of the object which makes the sides not smooth)  

Yey cool now we can finally export  

Click **Save to disk** and save it somewhere on your computer, if you have a thumbdrive plugged in it will automatically save to your thumbdrive (and let you know as well) The file format is a **.gcode** file  

The thumbdrive will be plugged into the 3D printer
