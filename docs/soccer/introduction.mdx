# Introduction

This guide teaches you how to use each of the respective softwares that we use both for Lightweight and Open but it will not teach you how to build the actual robot  
So hopefully after a thorough explanantion of the software that we use, I hope that you would be able to blame yourself instead of blaming the tools cos remember some of them are <b>INDUSTRY STANDARD</b> people pay alot of money for this and you get it for free ðŸ™‚
